**LibNameplateRegistry-1.0** is an embeddable library providing an abstraction layer for tracking and querying Blizzard's Nameplate frames with ease and efficiency.

Features:
---------
- Provides callbacks to track nameplate appearance and disappearance.
- Caches and maintain nameplates' related data
- Provides a simple API to extract information from nameplate
- Links GUID to nameplates
- Provides auto-diagnostic features to detect incompatibilities

Please note that **LibNameplateRegistry-1.0** is _still in development_ and so the provided [API][api] is quite limited at the moment. Do not hesitate to [request features via the ticket system][tickets].


As this library focuses on optimization and simplicity, it will never try to be compatible with other nameplate add-ons. It will be naturally compatible with such other add-ons as long as they are coded properly. Like Healers Have To Die it includes means (callbacks) of identifying and reporting incompatibility issues so developers can act accordingly.


Check the [API documentation][api] and [callbacks details][callbacks] to see how to use this library.




This library is an adaptation of the _NameplateRegistry.lua_ sub-module of [Healers Have To die][HHTD].
