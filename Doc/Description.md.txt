This library is an adaptation of the NameplateRegistry.lua sub-module of Healers Have To die.

**LibNameplateRegistry-1.0** is an embeddable library providing an abstraction layer for tracking and querying Blizzard's Nameplate frames with ease and efficiency.

Features:
---------
- Provides callbacks to track nameplate appearance and disappearance.
- Caches and maintain nameplates' related data
- Provides a simple API to extract information from nameplate
- Links GUID to nameplates

*Please note that **LibNameplateRegistry-1.0** is still in development and so the provided API is quite limited at the moment. Do not hesitate to request features via the ticket system.*


As this library focuses on optimization and simplicity, it will never try to be compatible with other nameplate add-ons. It will be naturally compatible with such other add-ons as long as they are coded properly. Like Healers Have To Die it includes means (callbacks) of identifying and reporting incompatibility issues so developers can act accordingly.


Documentation is a work in progress, here is a quick list of the implemented
callbacks and public API


** Main callbacks: **
 LNR_ON_NEW_PLATE,
 LNR_ON_RECYCLE_PLATE,
 LNR_ON_GUID_FOUND

** Diagnostic callbacks: **
 LNR_DEBUG,
 LNR_ERROR_FATAL_INCOMPATIBILITY,
 LNR_ERROR_GUID_ID_HAMPERED,
 LNR_ERROR_SETPARENT_ALERT,
 LNR_ERROR_SETSCRIPT_ALERT

** Public API: **

:GetPlateName(plateFrame),
:GetPlateReaction(plateFrame),
:GetPlateType(plateFrame),
:GetPlateGUID(plateFrame),
:GetPlateByGUID(GUID),
:EachPlateByName()

Until the documentation is complete you can take a look at Healers Have To Die
latest alpha which uses this library.
